# South Park Dialog explorer

I made this dialog explorer to try out `streamlit` and friends wanted to have
a look at it.

## Install

```sh
$ pip install streamlit
```

### The data

I used the data from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tovarischsukhov/southparklines). Create a `data` folder on the same level as `code` and rename the file to `southpark-all-seasons.csv`.

## How to run

In the `code` folder, run:

```sh
$ streamlit run south-park.py
```

It should open a web browser with the app.
