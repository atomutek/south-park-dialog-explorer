# South Park Dialog explorer

I made this dialog explorer to try out `streamlit` and friends wanted to have
a look at it, so here we here.

## Install

```sh
$ pip install streamlit
```

### The data

I used the data from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tovarischsukhov/southparklines).

1. Create a `data` folder on the same level as `code`
2. Download the file from [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tovarischsukhov/southparklines)
3. Place the csv file in `data`
4. Rename the file to `southpark-all-seasons.csv`.

## How to run

In the `code` folder, run:

```sh
$ streamlit run south-park.py
```

It should open a web browser with the app.
